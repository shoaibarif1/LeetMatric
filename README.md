LeetMetric is a responsive web application that helps users track their problem-solving performance on LeetCode. By entering their LeetCode username, users can view statistics on the number of problems solved across different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) and monitor their total submissions.

## Features

* User Input Validation: Ensures usernames are in the correct format.
* Visual Progress Circles: Dynamic circular progress bars show completion rates for each difficulty level.
* Detailed Submission Cards: Displays total submission counts for Easy, Medium, and Hard problems.
* Responsive & Modern UI: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices with a sleek, attractive design.
Error Handling: Notifies users if an invalid username is entered or if there are issues fetching data.

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript: For DOM manipulation and data fetching.
* CSS: For responsive and modern styling.
* HTML: For structuring the application.
* LeetCode GraphQL API: Fetches user data for problem-solving statistics.


## How the App Works

* Data Fetching: LeetMetric fetches data from LeetCodeâ€™s API using a proxy server to avoid CORS issues.
* Data Processing: User stats are processed and displayed in both progress circles and submission cards.
* Responsive Design: The application adjusts to various screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on any device.

## Usage
* Open the application.
* Enter your LeetCode username in the input box.
* Click on the Search button to retrieve and view your statistics.
